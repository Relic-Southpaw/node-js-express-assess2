### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?
  JSON Web Token

- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?
 A unique signature added that certifies that only the people holding
 the private key has access to I think?

- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
 yes


- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
 encryptions and unique tokens for the ones who access it verifying specific users and authentications.

- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
 


- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock? 
 like making fake things to test. 
 like temp requests, posts and data.
 you'd mock pulls and different data as well as
 modifying, adding, and deleting.

- What is continuous integration?
 constantly add little by little?

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
 a variable so you can set a testing environment seperate
 from the production environment so your tests do not effect
 the final product if something goes wrong.

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
 I think that's writing tests first that will fail, then 
 writing the codes that make the program do what you want it to do
 and so that they pass the tests.  I should really practice this.

- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
 Makes sure data entered can be used to complete what is needed
 And sets limits for parameters and what is required

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
  The ones with possibilities to throw errors? I honestly need
  to get better with the testing part.

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
 Returns what was updated, good to use when something is updated
 and you want to make sure the new information is correct.

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?

- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?

  I prefer Python, definitely.  The language overall seems more cut and dry, and javaScript just seems so loose at times.  So flask is
  a lot easier for me I think because Python makes more sense to me for some reason.
